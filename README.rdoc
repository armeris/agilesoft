== Welcome to AgileSoft

This is the source code of the development version of my personal website http://agilesoft.es

The application is a very simple blog developed using Rails 3.2.

I developed this blog when I was starting with Rails, so the code is not very good, indeed it is very bad. So don't look at it very close ;)

To run the application you just need to create the file config/database.yml with a database connection and load the db schema running rake db:schema:load
